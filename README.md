# DirectIQ Rest API Document

Welcome to the DirectIQ REST API document. You can use our API to access DirectIQ data endpoints to read/write objects like contacts, campaigns, templates and more.

## Getting Started

To connect to the API with basic auth you need the following:

* Secure URL pointing to a Bigcommerce store
* Username of DirectIQ account
* API key for the user

## Authentication

An important part of authentication is your API key. You can access your API key from **My Account > Social Media & Integrations > API Integration** in your DirectIQ dashboard.
